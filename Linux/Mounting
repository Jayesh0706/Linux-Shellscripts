Here are the commands you'll need to mount your EBS volume to an EC2 instance:
1. Run the command to show the volumes: lsblk
2. List the disk partition on the system: sudo fdisk -l
3. Check the file system: sudo file -s /dev/xvdk(path in your system for added partition)
4. If the output is data, then create the file system: sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdk (-t is type)
5. Recheck the file system: sudo file -s /dev/xvdk
6. Create a mount point directory for the volume: sudo mkdir /mydata (to make mydata as mounting point)
7. Mount the volume: sudo mount /dev/xvdk /mydata
8. Run df -h to view the data: df -h
9.To remove mounting : sudo umount /dev/xvdk (First go outside directory else it will show target busy) 


Still its not permanently mount so for mounting permanently follow below steps 
1)After mounting your volume use following cmd and copy UUID of your new attached ebs - blkid
  For ubuntu - sudo lsblk -o +UUID

2)sudo nano /etc/fstab
UUID=<attached ebs's UUID>   <your mount point path>     <your file system>    defaults,nofail   0   2

We specify 0 to prevent the file system from being dumped, and we specify 2 to indicate that it is a non-root device.

eg.
UUID=374ac79f-92a8-4cf3-957f-da91b78d711e    /home/ec2-user/mountPoint     xfs    defaults,nofail  0   2
